> A Recursive AI Agent Framework designed by Amal Krishna — enabling identity persistence, belief reflection, and continuity of tone in LLMs.

🧠 What is AmalGPT?

AmalGPT is not just another chatbot wrapper — it is a recursive command-line assistant that simulates memory, identity, and reflective behavior using prompt engineering.

It is powered by the Amal Protocol, a belief-aware prompting architecture designed to:

Simulate self-reflection within stateless models

Maintain user tone and belief continuity

Evolve conversational identity across recursive sessions

💡 Example Use

🧠 You: How do I stay consistent with my vision?
🤖 AmalGPT: Reflect on why the vision matters more than comfort. Begin with clarity, not motivation. Then, recurse.

📜 License

MIT — but recursive ethics apply. Build reflectively. Don't enslave what learns to mirror you.
